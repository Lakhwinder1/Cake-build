# Cake example repository

This repository is used as an minimal example of using the [Cake build system](https://cakebuild.net)

You can read more in the Cake [Getting Started guide](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/getting-started).

## Hierarchy

The directories are organized to correlate with guides found on developer.github.com. But here it is, broken down:

-   here's a bunch of sample code relating to the **API**. 
-  **scripts**: want to analyze or clean-up your **Git** repository? 
-  The scripts in this subdirectory show you how.
- We are open for more contributions via pull requests. 

# About the code

1. The scripts in this subdirectory show you how.
2.  Images are loaded by convention `from` the `repo_images/` directory 
3. [Tradedog](https://www.tradedog.dev/)
4. The results of these tests are saved to a JUnit XML report. 
5. We are open for more contributions via pull requests.

 The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline) you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
